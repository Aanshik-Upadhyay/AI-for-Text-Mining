# AI-for-Text-Mining
Made an AI using Python.
This code initializes a RoBERTa model and trains it on a training set, evaluating it on the validation set. A dataset was obtained from Huggingface with different tweets about books, movies and sports and the AI categorized the different tweets in these classes based on the training it received.
